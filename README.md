# PWA Text Editor üìù

## Description
This web text editor is built using Progressive Web App technology which allows for data persistence both on and offline and allows for app installation on local machines. This application proved a challenge in many ways, one of the most unexpected ways being how persistent the data could be from testing/load to reload, it often took restarts of many part of this project/deletion of many databases/storage locations. Overall the project works as the outline describes.

## Installation Instructions
For this application, you are able to download it, however it is best experienced (and perhaps easier to test) using the heroku live demo online found under the usage guidelines. If downloaded, npm install all of the required components and reference the 
root package.json to decide how you want to execute the application. For testing npm run start should work.

## Usage Guidelines
When the user is presented with the site, they are greeted with a splash greeting text. When they make adjustments to the page, they can leave the page and return to find their chances made. When the users click the install button in the top left of the screen the application will download and install locally allowing for the PWA to run outside of the heroku workspace. Application works both on and offline as well!
